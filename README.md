Order in Chaos.

Everything is just gambling, a job is a low risk gamble, betting on a number on roulette is a high risk gamble.

Options is on the higher risk side but like everything in life if you have a proven system it should go well.

With your job you think its safe and there is zero risk, but if you didn't' show up, and didn't treat people nicely you wouldn't have a job, there is a strategy! Just like with options, you arrive with a plan and act within certain conditions and then exit with certain conditions it is less risky.

The markets are risky but can be managed with certain strategies, but the problem is they think its a free for all, its not. There is structure and order and we have to behave accordingly.
